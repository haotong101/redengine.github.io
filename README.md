I haven't found a fantastic and easy way to convert all HTML5 video types yet - there are many 'silver bullets' but none of them work for everything or output poor quality video.  However, I'm still looking!  

Here is the best way I've found so far - yes, it's a bit convoluted and fiddly! - but it works...

Conversion - tools required:
  + [Miro Video Convertor](http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/)
  + [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/index.html)
  + [MovieConvertor](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/movieconverter/id413883804?mt=12)
  + [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
  + [QuickTime](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/)
  + [Elmedia Player](http://mac.eltima.com/media-player.html)
    
Conversion - method:
  1. Get original (MOV or MP4) file and rename if necessary (remove spaces, funny characters etc)
  2. Using Miro Video Convertor - convert MOV to MP4 - test output with QuickTime
  3. Using Miro Video Convertor - convert MP4 to WEBM - test output with FireFox
  4. Using MovieConvertor - convert MP4 to SWF (same as source - all options) - test output with Elmedia Player
  5. Using VLC Media Player - convert MOV/MP4 to "Video - Theora + Vorbis (OGG)" - change file extension to '.ogv' test in VLC AND FireFox
