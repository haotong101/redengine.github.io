    <p>The Red Engine team has a wealth of experience in publishing and print. From design and creative direction through to print production and management - their knowledge is broad and well renowned.</p>

    <p>Our wide ranging experience and expertise offers clients end-to-end technical expertise with a team who are able to take any project from initial concept, through design, content creation, production, into print (and, if required, seamlessly online).</p> 

    <p>Whether it's magazines, books, brochures or catalogue... publishing content about  food, finance music or travel... we have the knowledge and expertise to produce the best end product for you.</p>

    <p>That's why our latest collaboration with Iconic Images is such a good pairing. 'Bowie by O'Neill' is the product of this joint venture. We've created a luxury, fine-art book of Terry O'Neill's photography archive of David Bowie, featuring largely unseen images. Both companies are very proud and excited.</p>

    <p>This addition to the Red Engine Media and Iconic Images portfolios is to be published in September 2016 - a unique collector's edition, limited to just 500 copies.</p>
