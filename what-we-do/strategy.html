    <h2>STRATEGY</h2>

    <p>The choices an organisation makes about its strategy rely heavily on its culture - just as patterns of behaviour can emerge as strategy, patterns of thinking will shape an organisation's perspective, and the things that it is able to do well.</p>

    <p><strong>What's your approach to developing strategy?</strong></p>
    
    <p>Many of us brainstorm opportunities, and then plan how we'll take advantage of them.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, while this type of approach is important, we need to think about much more than this if we want to be successful.</p>
    
    <p>After all, there's no point in developing a strategy that ignores competitors' reactions, or doesn't consider the culture and capabilities of your organisation. And it would be wasteful not to make full use of your company's strengths - whether these are obvious or not.</p>
    
    <p>Management expert, Henry Mintzberg, argued that it's really hard to get strategy right. To help us think about it in more depth, in 1987 he developed his 5 Ps of Strategy - five different definitions of (or approaches to) developing strategy:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Plan.</li>
      <li>Ploy.</li>
      <li>Pattern.</li>
      <li>Position.</li>
      <li>Perspective.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Developing a Better Strategy</strong></p>

    <p>As a Plan, strategy needs to be developed in advance and with purpose.</p>

    <p>As a Ploy, strategy is a means of outsmarting the competition.</p>
    
    <p>With strategy as a Pattern, we learn to appreciate that what was successful in the past can lead to success in the future.</p>
    
    <p>With Position, strategy is about how the organisation relates to its competitive environment, and what it can do to make its products unique in the marketplace.</p>
    
    <p>Perspective emphasises the substantial influence that organisational culture and collective thinking can have on strategic decision making within a company.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding and using each element helps you develop a robust, practical and achievable business strategy.</p>

    <p>Instead of trying to use the 5 Ps as a process to follow while developing strategy, think of them as a variety of viewpoints that you should consider while developing a robust and successful strategy.</p>
