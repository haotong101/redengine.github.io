  The team at Red Engine has over 15 years experience. The business has seen rapid growth and has doubled in size over the last 2 years and continues to enhance its reputation, delivering outstanding results particularly in the travel tourism and leisure markets. Mark's initial expertise was in print but in today's world of cluttered marketing and everything digital he has used his creative expertise to build ideas that stand out from the crowd, to embrace traditional and new technologies whatever the budget he has to work with.

  Why the name?
</p>

<p>
  The name Red Engine is a simple one, borne out of his young son's love and fascination of Fire Engines as a toddler. He found himself forever tripping over a number of red engines each morning and couldn't help but love his son's adoration of a shiny new red engine at Christmas even when he already had a large collection!
