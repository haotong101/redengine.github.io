    <h2>SMART CONTENT</h2>
    
    <p>We will help you to create content that conforms to the principles of <strong>'COPE' - create once and publish everywhere</strong>. So before you think about how and where you're going to store your content to make it accessible and available, we'll be thinking about the content itself, who is it for, what is its purpose and how it can work across each channel to ensure you get a maximum return on your investment in new content.</p>
