<h2>Tone of Voice</h2>
<p>Developing two unique image styles for the Thomson and First Choice holiday brands.</p>

      <p>We considered each brand’s tone of voice.</p>
      <p>We developed personas – what do these people like to do… and how would they behave… we even thought about how they would dress!</p>
      <p>We considered different photographic techniques.</p>
      <p>And all of this thinking resulted in the confident and distinctive brand images styles now being used for both Thomson and First Choice.</p>
      <p>Thomson… Warm, calm, expert and insightful. Cool, stylish and a little restrained. Relaxed and happy people. Softer tones with a more personal and intimate feel.</p>
      <p>First Choice… Fun and energetic, yet understanding and nurturing. Bright and cheery with lots of personality. Upbeat people with a sense of energy. Bold colour and interesting angles.</p>
      <p>Here's a selection to show the difference.</p>
