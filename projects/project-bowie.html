      <p>When David Bowie passed away our MD Mark, a life-long Bowie fan, was visiting Errestampa, one of our print partners. He’d wanted to showcase the work of David Bowie for some time and his passing acted as the catalyst to bring his concept to life.</p>
      <p>‘Bowie by O’Neill’ is a deluxe book that breaks the boundary of traditional publishing. A unique tribute to David Bowie showcasing the work of famed photographer Terry O’Neill, this projects is something that Mark is hugely proud of and he was overwhelmed when David’s wife Iman requested a copy of the book.</p>
      <p>Bowie by O’Neill is a unique, fine-art publication, our first collaboration with Iconic Images.
