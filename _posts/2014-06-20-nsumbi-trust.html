<p>The team at Red Engine are delighted to announce the Nsumbi Trust as our chosen charity. We will be organising fund raising events to help raise money for this incredibly worthwhile cause. First up is a charity golf day which will be taking place on 31st July this year at the Centurion Club in Hertfordshire.</p> 

<p>Nsumbi Trust cares for children and young people in Uganda who have lost parents or who live in appalling poverty without access to life's essentials. Established in 2001, today their Children's Centre and Hostel offers primary education, healthcare, food and accommodation for 500 children. Work began on building a secondary school in 2012. From this year the school provides a secondary education through to 'O' level to it's students, alongside training in farming and brick making. It is said in Uganda that anyone who can farm or make bricks will not only always earn money but will provide employment for others. Nsumbi Trust want all their children to fulfil their potential. Their very able students continue to 'A' level also and this year 5 students are at university studying law, journalism, medicine, management and leadership. It is amazing what a child will achieve given the opportunity. Nsumbi Trust are a small organisation run mostly by volunteers and almost all the opportunities given to their children have been provided by individuals here in UK.</p>
