<p>Welcoming in 2016 and we're all back to work this week - and as promised, time to share a couple of our new video projects.<p>


<p>The Centurion Club is a world-renowned private golf course near St Albans in Hertfordshire - designed by international course architect Simon Gidman. Our brief was to capture and show off the course's beautiful greens, water features and 80 bunkers - well we didn't quite make it around all 80 bunkers, but anyway...take a look <a href="https://vimeo.com/148231001" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">here</a> at our dawn to dusk shoot and get a feel of what the club offers its members.</p>

<p>Our second project is a video we shot just before Christmas at the award winning Galvin La Chapelle restaurant, Spital Square, East London - pictured below.<p>

<p>La Chapelle's historic location is in the grade 2 listed St. Botolph's hall, dating back to 1890. The building originally used by the neighbouring school and parish curates' was lovingly and beautifully renovated in 2009 by chefs Jeff and Chris Galvin, turning it into a restaurant.<p>
 
<p>This video captures the food, the atmosphere and the service in this spectacular but still intimate space. I can definitely recommend a visit – the food and interior are both fantastic. And the lemon souffle, featured in our video, well let’s just say, it didn't last long post shoot!!!<p> Take a look at the complete video <a href="https://vimeo.com/147586799" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">here.</a>
 
<p>On the print side - we've just printed the latest 'Wedding Venues and Services' magazine, along with the '100 Dream Dresses' supplement - well worth a look if you're looking for some big day inspiration.</p>

<p>Well it's a new year and so weird, it's almost feeling like spring!!!<p>
