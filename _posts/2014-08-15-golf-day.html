<p>Nsumbi Trust, a small charity run mostly by volunteers, cares for children and young people in Nsumbi in Uganda who have lost parents or who live in appalling poverty without access to life's essentials. Established in 2001, today their Children's Centre and Hostel offers primary education, healthcare, food and accommodation for 500 children.</p>

<p>Red Engine organised a charity golf day at The Centurion Golf Club near St Albans to raise vital funds for a specific project currently being pioneered by the charity to source a water supply for the Children's Centre in Uganda, which has been relying on water collected from roofs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"We have men who are drilling by hand and lifting the earth out by the bucket load at the moment to source a supply. They have dug to 100ft and have found some water but still need to go deeper. We will then need to fit a pump and a raised water tank so that we can have running water for the centre. The money which the golf day aims to raise is vital for the project, it will allow us to fund the pump, tank and distribution of the supply."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As well as backing this project with Nsumbi Trust, the day will also be raising money for the England Footballers Foundation, established in 2007 when the players made the decision to donate England their match fees and time to good causes.</p>

<p>A great day was had by all, with vital funds raised for two exceptional organisations.</p>
