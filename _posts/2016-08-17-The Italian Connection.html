<p>Some more insights from Bowie by O'Neill.

<p>As Red Engine is based in the UK and Italy it will come as no surprise that we have chosen to work with our excellent Italian print partners Errestampa for the printing of this project.</p>

<p>And the Italian connection doesn't stop there - with specialist graphic papers from the Gruppo Cordenous paper mill, and the book being bound and finished by Legatoria Bergamasca bookbinders.</p> 

<p>This project's success is down to the combining of expertise and a massif team effort - we are now really excited and looking forward to launch!</p>
