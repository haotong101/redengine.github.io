<p class="lead">Video content is a key tool for any marketing professional. Any brand yet to embrace it, is simply being left behind.</p>

<p>The explosion of online platforms, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">Twitter</a> to newer social platforms such as <a href="https://vine.co/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">vine</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">Instagram</a> ensures that any shrewd video marketing strategy will move far beyond simply putting a video up on the brand website.</p>

<p>Instead, marketing professionals are increasingly creating video content and ensuring that the asset works as hard as possible by editing different formats to suit each target platform accordingly. Maximising audience reach and ROI as a result.</p>

<p>Along with this, consumers now live multi-screen lifestyles influenced by variety of output devices available: from PCs, to laptops, to mobiles and tablets.</p>
 
<p>As well as this surge in the number of platforms and outlets, a straightforward video doesn't really cut it anymore. At Red Engine, we are increasingly looking to push the boundaries with video. From creating 360 degree video content, to interactive video which takes you through to a point of purchase, video can now offer a two-way experience to the consumer which heightens brand engagement levels and can even open up new revenue streams.</p>
 
<p>Video is also powerful from an SEO perspective because <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">Google</a> seeks out rich media content, favouring this over static web pages. Further to this, the video asset itself then helps you to stand out against the other search results that appear.</p>

<p>As well as creating engaging content, it is equally important to develop a watertight media plan which ensures that you work the asset as hard as possible, rather than simply putting a video on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">YouTube</a> and expecting consumers to find it themselves.</p>

<p>Whilst underpinning everything, you must have a standout creative concept. After all, once you have driven your target audience to your video, it is important that the content itself is captivating, not too long and holds their attention.</p>
