<p>Video has been an incredibly powerful tool for the marketing industry from the word go. Why? The stats speak for themselves:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>People remember 80% of what they see and hear, compared to only 20% of what they read (<a href="http://www.globalspeak.com" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">www.globalspeak.com</a>)</li>
    <li>Whilst 64% of website visitors are more likely to buy a product on an online retail site after watching a video (<a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">www.youtube.com</a>)</li>
  </ul> 

<p>With the introduction of autoplay video to Facebook, it is not a surprise that video seems to be taking over the social networking platform, one status update at a time.</p>

<p>The success of the ice bucket challenge is a great case in point. According to Facebook, 17 million videos of people willingly pouring freezing cold water over themselves were watched between 1st June and 1st September this year. The videos were viewed by 440 million different people, 10 billion times. These figures are truly impressive. Is it just a coincidence that these timings coincide with autoplay video really starting to take off on Facebook? Highly unlikely. Could it in fact be integral to the levels of success achieved? Highly likely.</p>

<p>Recently, Facebook announced that it will be launching a video view counter, very similar to what YouTube already provides. Yet another indication that video will continue to dominate Facebook more and more.</p>

<p>Content is at the heart of everything we do at Red Engine, with video playing a significant part in what we produce for our clients. It is really important to COPE (Create Once, Publish Everywhere) and Facebook (and social media more widely) must certainly be factored in to this equation.</p>

<p>With this in mind, we have produced an infographic to illustrate just some of the many different social media outlets that video can be used for:</p>
