<p>Red Engine recently produced a music video for the talented pianist and album producer/arranger Clifford Slapper.</p>

<p>‘Stay’, with vocals by Marcella Puppini is the debut single from the forthcoming album ‘Bowie Songs One’ by Clifford Slapper & Friends - the project was half way through being recorded when Bowie sadly died in January 2016.</p> 

<p>‘All songs on the album are stripped bare to reveal their emotional core’. <i>Clifford Slapper</i></p>

<p>The video emulates this sentiment with its pared-down dramatic atmosphere, monochromatic mood and cabaret feel - enabling the full power of the lyrics to shine through.</p>
 
<p>Clifford worked closely with Bowie, playing for him on his last ever television appearance. Other collaborations have included Marc Almond, Boy George, Holly Johnson, Jarvis Cocker, Suggs (Madness), Stereo MCs and Lisa Stansfield.</p>

<p>The album will be released in March 2017.</p>

<p>Now, from music and video to illustration and print!</p>

<p>We’ve been illustrating, designing and printing a fun project for Betterware.</p>

<p><br><img src="/public/images/posts/music-and-maps/betterware-map-crop.jpg" class='img-responsive'/><br>

<p>We had to create a collection of colourful fun characters and an illustrate map - a bit of visual story-telling to capture Betterware's distribution set up. That theme then continued through to the designing of a leaflet of events/highlights for their 2017 calendar.</p>

<p>Many real-life figure observations and people watching were used in the making of this project, great fun, although you’ll never be able to recognise yourself - identities are a closely guarded secret!</p>

<p>And lastly, the shortest day has been and gone, Christmas is here, and we’re looking forward to an exciting 2017!</p>
