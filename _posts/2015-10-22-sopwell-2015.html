<p>Autumn's well and truly with us, summer's already a distant memory and there
have been quite a few changes here at Red Engine.
 
<p>Firstly, we've relocated to our new office, and are working from the top floor of a converted mill, next to the River Ver in St Albans. As you can see, quite a visual contrast to our last location.<p>
 
<p>Along with the new view we've updated our logo, which features in our latest showreel, if you want to take a look it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO25Tel_-Rg" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">here.</a> Everything else is the same, the team, the furniture, and the bad jokes...<p>
 
<p>On the print front, we've secured some great European sole agency agreements. With Prinovis, Germany - selling in Southern Europe and with Tiber, Italy - selling web offset and Mastergraph, also in Italy, selling high quality sheet fed and digital - both throughout Europe.<p>
 
<p>The team have been off filming in various UK locations, searching for that ever illusive good weather window, challenging I know. But having just seen Baltasar Kormakur's film 'Everest', where the crew and cast were out in all weathers, experiencing some punishing weather conditions, including snow, well there's no competition really, all in a day's work.<p>

<p>We've also got several other projects happening, that we hope to be able to share with you soon.<p>

<p>And lastly, we had a bit of fun over the Summer, creating a few illustrated holiday postcards, we thought you'd enjoy us sharing them with you - I'm sure you can recognise the faces.
