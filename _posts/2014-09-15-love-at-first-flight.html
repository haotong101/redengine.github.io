<p>Here at Red Engine we love to be up-to-date with filming innovations. This is why we couldn't wait to get our hands on one of the latest filming kit sensations, the drone.</p>

<p>When one says the word drone one cannot help but think of military weaponry or of some kind of Sci-Fi device. In fact a drone simply is, by definition, a, remotely controlled, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Today however, it has become the new media wow factor, accessible thanks to its mainstream release.</p> 

<p>Our creative director Des Curran chose to test the DJI Phantom drone in conjunction with a GoPro Hero 3.</p>

<p>It was love at first flight.</p>

<p>This new aerial device introduces a new unique perspective on our client's products adding instant value.</p> 

<p>Most recently we have used the DJI Phantom drone in the seaside town of Torquay in Devon and on the Greek Island of Crete, capturing in both locations breathtaking views, hotels and resorts.</p>

<p>Drones are an incredibly powerful piece of marketing weaponry for the travel and leisure industries especially. Obtaining aerial footage to showcase resorts or hotel complexes used to involve hiring helicopters at great expense. However the drone has quashed such barriers and this is a technique that the industry needs to embrace. This filming technique offers endless possibilities for the sector.</p>
