		<p>Here at Red Engine we love print! It's a passion we've been pursuing for over 15 years and today we're excited to share with you one of our most recent and, may I add, most lavish projects.</p>

		<p>Riding on 'Downton Abbey 's' growing international success, luxury Event Company, Dickins &amp; Hawkes, contacted Red Engine to produce a trilingual brochure promoting their immersive, 'Downton Abbey' style, holidays.</p>

		<p>Indeed, 'Dickins &amp; Hawkes' give their customers the opportunity to experience the British show's lifestyle, allowing the clientele to stay in grand country houses with luxuriant grounds, facilities and staff all dressed up in period costumes from the early 20th century.</p>

		<p>The brochure pack had to accompany 'Dickins &amp; Hawkes' promotional video, accommodate English and Mandarin and illustrate the stylish elegance of the beginning of the 1920s. (See video here <a href='http://www.dickinsandhawkes.com'>http://www.dickinsandhawkes.com</a>)</p>

		<p>Our Art Director, Des Curran, started his work by simplifying the company's logo. His aim was to create a more basic design that would echo the Art deco style fonts and monograms he had selected.</p>

		<p>His Art Deco inspired work not only resonates with the 1920s era but also has an Oriental feel appealing to Chinese readers.</p>

		<p>Ivory was chosen as the main colour, giving the brochure a pleasant lustre finish whilst the chocolate brown for the writing and the packet sleeve added a universal earthiness relating to country life.</p>

		<p>Finally, our Art Director took care of the picture layout, picking several stills taken during the video shoot and using thermography printing for the chocolate brown sleeve and for the first page of the brochure.</p>

		<p>This thermography printing creates an embossed sleeve, giving the brochure pack a grand and glamorous final touch reminiscent of the opulence and splendour awaiting the future residents.</p>
