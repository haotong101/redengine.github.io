<p>This month it's all about the weather and early starts.<p> 

<p>Our weather related idents were produced for the holiday brand Thomson. The idents' purpose was to lead the viewer into the weather feature whilst advertising the Thomson brand. The aim was to capture a warm, relaxing and exotic destination feel - helping to evoke great trip memories to ultimately encourage viewers to book their next holiday experience. Take a look <a href="https://vimeo.com/145868697" target="_blank" class="highlight-link">here </a> to see a few back to back.<p>

<p>We've also been out on the golf course, here's Keith's summary...<p>

<p>The brief was to shoot a golf course in a day, in late autumn during a week of driving rain. And don't forget to capture the sunrise. And by the way you also need to use a drone - no problem!!!<p>

<p>Our well-behaved drone did us proud, despite its preference for only going out on high summer days, in light winds.<p>
 
<p>Our key elements for success were having a patient professional golfer who could shoot on demand again, and again and again... Carrying out a comprehensive recce to pre select our holes - you can't make it round all 18 holes on an October day, unless you fancy a spot of night golf. Although you can (and we did) get some great interior shots once the sun went down, in the clubhouse - it would have been rude not to, obviously.<p>
 


<p>And finally, we warned all the club members that we would be out and about armed with cameras, a drone and likely to be standing in their way whenever they lined up that perfect shot.</p>
 
It was all good, a success from sun up until sun down. Above are a few screen snaps as a taster, until we can share the completed video with you.<p>

</p>Last week I got to take some behind the scenes pictures whilst the rest of the team were shooting a video. We were in a really lovely restaurant in Spitalfields, East London - you can see below.<p>

<p>The only downside having to photograph and be around fantastic food dishes having had no breakfast - it was an early start!!! <p>

<p>A lemon souffle left over from the shoot definitely went down well. We can't divulge the location just yet but we'll let you know as soon as we can<p>
 
<p>Print related we've added a few lovely new print samples to our site, one of my favourites is the Boss brochure with its lovely monochromatic fashion imagery.
