<p>We're all inspired by film here, so it should be no surprise that my film of the month is Ben Wheatley's High-Rise.<p>

<p>Based on a book by JG Ballard, and set in a 1970's tower block, it just oozes a futuristic retro style from start to finish, well apart from when the whole shared community living experience of its tenants breaks down and disintegrates.</p>

<p>It was definitely a decadent and style heavy feast of architecture, typography, products, fashion, and car park full of 70's classic cars - a real mix of glamour and style, the dark and dysfunctional, with some humour thrown in.<p>

<p>Reading about the prop design, typography and repeat pattern approach to supermarket design was inspiring. The designers immersed themselves in a 70's inspired wonderland of inspiration, including branding, products, typefaces, literature and more - shelves were like flowing artworks. Their research included a visit to the fantastic Museum of Brands, Notting Hill, London - having been there, I can confirm it's just like being let loose in sweet shop.<p>
 
<p>The inspirational strength of everyday items is so easily overlooked and often not truly appreciated until decades later - or perhaps it's just that we love a bit of good old nostalgia to heighten the design senses.</p>

<p>Probably time to mention that we too are working on an exciting print and design project - pop, 70's, icon... coming soon, so watch this space!!!<p>

<p>And here's what we've been up to as a team.<p>
    
<p>Not quite up to the elevated futuristic heights of 'High Rise' but still on a stylistic interior design theme, we've been working on some 3D computer generated illustration interior mock ups, pictured below.<p>

<p>And finally, on a 2D theme, we've been transforming some financial statistics and data into some infographics as part of a new branding project, pictured below.<p>
