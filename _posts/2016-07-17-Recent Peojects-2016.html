<p>It's been a while, so what have we been up to? A real mix of work including some design, video and illustration.<p>

<p>We've just completed a design concept for a Spanish visa centre - the project was a mix of 3D vector illustration, good old traditional pen and ink drawing and learning some Spanish and Chinese phrases in the process too.</p>

<p>Some of the team filmed at the England Footballers Foundation Lions and Roses charity fundraising event at Sopwell House in St Albans. The brilliant Jack Whitehall hosted the evening that also had Wayne Rooney performing with James Bay.<p>

<p>The event raised money for charitable causes including UNICEF, Honeypot Children's Charity and the EFF's own charity for disadvantaged youngsters. Click on the image below to view a time-lapse of the event from beginning to end.<p>

<p>And as we speak something really exciting, luxurious and very iconic is running on a printing press in Italy!!! And in the next couple of days we'll be revealing what that something is!!!</p>

<p>It's also that time of year again when all the colleges are showing off their students' work and I've taken the opportunity to go out and see what's happening - just an excuse to soak up some visual inspiration. I really enjoyed seeing the illustration, animation and storytelling that's emerging.<p>

<p>Some of the 3D animation sets at Central Saint Martins were brilliant - I always like a mix of hand-made processes with digital techniques, you just get a real richness.<p>
    
<p>So we'll be back soon with some news!<p>
