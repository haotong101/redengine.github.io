<p>Since our last blog we've seen the launch of the 'Bowie by O'Neill' fine-art book. There was the private view and exhibition at the Ransom Art gallery in London. Then last week there was an evening with Terry O'Neill, signing copies of the book.</p>

<p>Terry O'Neill is very proud of the book and commented "I look at these photos today and remember the times I had with David. He was an incredible genius and is greatly missed. There won't be another one like him."</p>

<p>From the initial concept, sparked by the death of David Bowie, through production and with the launch it's been a labour of love - a really special project to be involved with. </p>

<p>The project's included the synthesis of Terry O'Neill's Bowie archive; decisions on fonts, colours, materials and layouts; the writing, sourcing and checking of copy and quotes; and then the management of print and production. All this has been combined with Iconic Images' wealth of experience, excellent publishing experience and promotional expertise - collaboration at its best. </p>

<p>We've also finished a new branding project for financial company Fortem Capital - pictured below. We developed the brand from scratch - the name, logo, website, literature and stationery. We also helped them communicate their data with some infographics, injecting some colour and individual personality to their products.</p>

</p><p>Out and about recently I visited 'Tent London' - as part part of the London Design Festival. The venue at 'The Old Truman Brewery' in Brick Lane is a favourite of mine, down-to-earth, creative and refreshingly raw - lets hope it stays that way.</p>

<p>And the work, well just so much brilliant design and craft to choose from but Dan Isaac Wallin's (part of the Nordic Design Collective) hauntingly beautiful photographic images were definitely memorable. And in complete contrast, Amy Isles Freeman's quirky surface designs on wood - describing herself as 'Printmaker, Woodturner, Artist Person' - fantastic!</p>
