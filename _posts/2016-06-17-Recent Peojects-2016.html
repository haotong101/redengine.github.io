<p>It’s been a while, so what have we been up to? A real mix of work including some design, video and illustration.<p>

<p>We’ve just completed a design concept for a Spanish visa centre – the project was a mix of 3D vector illustration, good old traditional pen and ink drawing and learning some Spanish and Chinese phrases in the process too.</p>

<p>Some of the team filmed at the England Footballers Foundation Lions and Roses charity fundraising event at Sopwell House in St Albans. The brilliant Jack Whitehall hosted the evening that also had Wayne Rooney performing with James Bay.<p>

<p>The event raised money for charitable causes including UNICEF, Honeypot Children’s Charity and the EFF’s own charity for disadvantaged youngsters. Below is a link http://bit.ly/1WRsz1V to a little time lapse of the event from beginning to end.<p>
 
<p>And as we speak something really exciting, luxurious and very iconic is running on a printing press in Italy!!! And in the next couple of days we’ll be revealing what that something is!!!</p>

<p>Probably time to mention that we too are working on an exciting print and design project - pop, 70's, icon... coming soon, so watch this space!!!<p>

<p>And here's what we've been up to as a team.<p>
    
<p>Not quite up to the elevated futuristic heights of 'High Rise' but still on a stylistic interior design theme, we've been working on some 3D computer generated illustration interior mock ups, pictured below.<p>

<p>And finally, on a 2D theme, we've been transforming some financial statistics and data into some infographics as part of a new branding project, pictured below.<p>
