<p>Video content is a key tool for any marketing professional. Any brand yet to embrace it, is simply being left behind. The explosion of online platforms, from YouTube, Facebook and Twitter to newer social platforms such as vine and Instagram ensures that any shrewd video marketing strategy will move far beyond simply putting a video up on the brand website. Instead, marketing professionals are increasingly creating video content and ensuring that the asset works as hard as possible by editing different formats to suit each target platform accordingly. Maximising audience reach and ROI as a result. Along with this, consumers now live multi-screen lifestyles influenced by variety of output devices available: from PCs, to laptops, to mobiles and tablets.</p>
 
<p>As well as this surge in the number of platforms and outlets, a straightforward video doesn't really cut it anymore. At Red Engine, we are increasingly looking to push the boundaries with video.

<p>Video is also powerful from an SEO perspective because Google seeks out rich media content, favouring this over static web pages.
