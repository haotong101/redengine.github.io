<p>Being visually inspired by a recent trip to Copenhagen, and with it feeling decidedly Spring-like at the moment I started thinking about colour, trends and fashion, well it is London Fashion Week!</p>

<p>Pantone announced ‘Rose Quartz’ as its colour of the year last year, which has helped shake up colour gender stereotypes a bit – we saw pinks/pastels paired with black, in as many shades as you could possibly think of - right across print, digital, branding, fashion, furniture, and beyond… we like refreshingly gender neutral pink it seems!</p>

<p>Paul Smith’s decision to streamline and manage production costs by using one colour palette across his men’s and women’s collections has resulted in his SS17 collection being full of vibrant slightly muddy bright blocks of colour, stripes and checks, set against navy and white with a few oversized florals for a touch of feminine differentiation – it’s working for me.</p> 

<p>Pantone’s ‘Greenery’ for 2017, is according to their executive director Leatrice Eiseman, symbolising ‘”the reconnection we seek with nature, one another and a larger purpose”. It has a zingy freshness, with a renewal and regeneration and a back to nature vibe.</p>
 
<p>And this back to nature (mixed with the human form) leads nicely on to Burberry’s new catwalk collection for AW17, which sees their chief executive officer Christopher Bailey working with the Henry Moore Foundation. Burberry have used this iconic British artist’s work as inspiration for their new collection - his drawings, his sculpture, his colours, his observations from nature…</p>

<p>It’s obviously nothing new using art to inspire fashion, and this body of work is a perfect fit for the concept of going back to nature and bringing the outside in, not to mention the obvious crossover with fashion and sculpture.</p>
    
<p>The outcomes included some beautifully crafted and embellished capes, which looked stunning hanging in the Makers House gallery space in Soho – a clear roof was installed especially for the show, bringing the outside in, and showing off the accompanying Henry Moore sculptures as they were intended, in natural light.</p>

<p>The sculptural capes are beautiful, packed with embellishment and textile processes; the ‘Reclining Figures Print’ on cotton captured the draughtsman quality of Moore’s sketches, and the fabric choices were direct references from the work, studio and his environment.</p>

<p>Celebrating and championing brilliant design and craftsmanship in our fast paced technology driven environment is important – it feels refreshing, rejuvenating and it’s so important we don’t loose sight of the fact that everything depends on balance. We need the tactile and physically, we need to interact with design and the process!</p>

<p>And as Bowie (another fashion icon) By O’Neill (an iconic photographer) works it way around the globe, exhibiting in Tokyo last month - the publishing wheels are turning here, planning the next project…</p>

<p>There will also be a Q & A and book signing with Terry O’Neill on 16th March in support of London’s Book & Screen week, details to follow soon.</p>
